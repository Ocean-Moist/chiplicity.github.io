.. topic:: European Interoperability Framework recommendations on Open Standards

   **Recommendation 22**

   When establishing European public services, 
   public administrations should prefer open specifications, 
   taking due account of the coverage of functional needs, 
   maturity and market support. 
 
   [...]The level of openness of a formalised specification 
   is an important element in determining the possibility 
   of sharing and reusing software components 
   implementing that specification. [...]
   If the openness principle is applied in full: 

   *  All stakeholders have the same possibility of contributing 
      to the development of the specification 
      and public review is part of the decision-making process; 
      
   *  The specification is available for everybody to study; 

   *  Intellectual property rights related to the specification 
      are licensed on FRAND terms [Fair, reasonable and non discriminatory]
      or on a royalty-free basis in a way that allows implementation 
      in both proprietary and open source software.
      
   **Recommendation 21.**

   Public administrations should use a structured, transparent and 
   objective approach to assessing and selecting formalised specifications.

   **Definitions**
   
   Formalised Specifications : 
   Formalised specifications are either standards pursuant to EU Directive 98/34 
   or specifications established by ICT industry fora or consortia

   Standard :
   As defined in European legislation (Article 1, paragraph 6, of Directive 98/34/EC), 
   a standard is a technical specification approved by a recognised standardisation 
   body for repeated or continuous application, with which compliance is not 
   compulsory and which is one of the following: 
   
   -  international standard: a standard adopted by an international standardisation 
      organisation and made available to the public, 
   -  European standard: a standard adopted by a European standardisation body and 
      made available to the public, 
   -  national standard: a standard adopted by a national standardisation body and 
      made available to the public. 

   Standards developing organisation : 
   A chartered organisation tasked with producing standards and specifications, 
   according to specific, strictly defined requirements, procedures and rules. 
   Standards developing organisations include: 

   -  recognised standardisation bodies such as international standardisation 
      committees such as the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO), the 
      three European Standard Organisations: the European Committee for 
      Standardisation (CEN), the European Committee for Electrotechnical 
      Standardisation (CENELEC) or the European Telecommunications Standards 
      Institute (ETSI); 
   -  fora and consortia initiatives for standardisation such as the Organisation for the 
      Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS), the World Wide Web 
      Consortium (W3C) or the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
